Distill Chinese novel characters into reusable persona bundles, export relationship graphs, and let them speak again with their own personality, stance, bonds, and memory intact.

`zaomeng` is not a generic chatbot project.  
It is a focused workflow for character distillation, relationship extraction, graph export, and in-character interaction.

- distill character bundles from novels
- extract relationships and export graphs
- let characters enter `act` / `insert` / `observe`

If what you want is not “an AI chatting pleasantly,” but “Lin Daiyu sounds like Lin Daiyu, Qi Xia sounds like Qi Xia, and a whole cast can share one scene without collapsing into one voice,” that is exactly what this project is trying to do.

It is not trying to put a thin chatbot layer on top of fictional people.  
It is trying to do something more demanding:

- make characters reusable beyond a single summary
- make relationships visible, traceable, and reusable
- make dialogue sound like something that specific person would actually say

## Install

### Install the skill

The main publishable surface of this project is the `zaomeng-skill/` bundle.

```bash
# Install into OpenClaw
openclaw skills install wkbin/zaomeng-skill

# Install into ClawHub
npx clawhub@latest install zaomeng-skill
pnpm dlx clawhub@latest install zaomeng-skill
bunx clawhub@latest install zaomeng-skill

# Install into a local skills directory
python scripts/install_skill.py --skills-dir <your-skills-root>
```

### Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## What You Can Do With It

### 1. Distill Characters

Give it a novel, and it will try to build reusable persona bundles from the original text, including:

- core identity
- core motivation
- personality tone
- speaking style
- decision logic
- emotional triggers
- key bonds
- character arc

The goal is not a one-page summary. The goal is a persona bundle that can keep supporting later dialogue, roleplay, correction, and incremental updates.

### 2. Export Relationship Graphs

It does not stop at structured relationship fields. It also exports visual graphs so you can quickly see:

- who trusts whom
- who depends on whom
- where tension, rivalry, or conflict lives

Typical outputs include:

- relationship Markdown
- Mermaid source
- HTML graph
- SVG graph

### 3. Enter Character Interaction

After distillation, there are now **3 modes**:

- `act`: you speak as one character, either one-on-one or by joining a group scene directly
- `insert`: you do not play an existing character; you enter the scene as yourself and interact with the cast directly
- `observe`: you stay out of the scene and watch several characters carry the scene forward

The simplest way to think about them:

- use `act` when you want to step in as a role
- use `insert` when you want yourself to enter the fictional world
- use `observe` when you want to watch the cast interact without speaking as anyone

In `insert`, the first session creates a lightweight scene card for you, usually including:

- how the cast should address you
- what identity you have inside the scene
- whether you want natural, immersive, or probing interaction
- how much your presence should affect the scene

## Usage

The recommended order is simple:

1. provide the novel text or file
2. specify which characters you want distilled
3. wait for persona bundles and the relationship graph
4. then enter `act`, `insert`, or `observe`

### Natural-language requests that work well

```text
Distill Lin Daiyu, Jia Baoyu, and Xue Baochai from this novel
```

```text
After distillation, put Lin Daiyu, Jia Baoyu, and Xue Baochai into group chat mode
```

```text
Let me play Jia Baoyu. Lin Daiyu should answer me
```

```text
Let me enter Dream of the Red Chamber as myself and talk with Lin Daiyu and Jia Baoyu
```

```text
Generate the relationship graph. I want the HTML and SVG versions
```

## How It Works Now

The current version is **LLM-first**:

- the host or runtime LLM does the actual language generation
- `zaomeng` prepares prompts, persona bundles, relationship context, and helper outputs
- `zaomeng-skill` prefers reusing the model capability already provided by the host

The emphasis is no longer “hardcode a pile of rules and glue lines together.” The emphasis is giving the model clearer persona, relationship, and scene constraints so the output sounds more like the source character.

## Incremental Distillation

The project supports incremental distillation.

If a character from the same novel has already been distilled, the next pass does not blindly rebuild from scratch. It tries to reuse:

- `PROFILE`
- split persona files
- `MEMORY`
- user corrections

This works especially well for:

- serialized fiction with new chapters
- long novels processed in batches
- repeated correction loops that keep improving persona quality

## Project Layout

The repository is currently split into three main layers:

- `src/`: core source code
- `zaomeng-skill/`: the publishable skill bundle
- `tests/`: regression tests

The most important assets inside the skill bundle are usually:

- `prompts/`
- `references/`
- `tools/prepare_novel_excerpt.py`
- `tools/build_prompt_payload.py`
- `tools/export_relation_graph.py`

## One-line Summary

`zaomeng` is not trying to be “an AI that can talk.”  
It is trying to let fictional people speak again with their own personality, relationships, tone, and memory intact.
